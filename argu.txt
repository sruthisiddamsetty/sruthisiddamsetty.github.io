I have certain doubts in recent  repeorts given by super screen movie production company as details are not clear why crowd is not rushing to good quality screens,which I will discuss in following essay.

There have mentioned in the report lesser people are coming to super screen-produced movies compared to previous year ,They have not given exact numbers to make the difference of people who were attending before,does not have clear evidence for supporting statement,in subsequent line inspite of fewer people they got positive reviews ,which means may be rich people can only afford this screens  and It cannot be beared by middle class people ,could be these screens are collecting huge amount of money in form of tickets from customers.Therefore rich people who are watching giving positive reviews as for good quality screens.But others who think waste of money would go to other screens .So theatres owners shouls reduce the ticket price for making many people to walk to theaters

I have question arising for the reading line lack of information about available quality screens in public,Might be production people are not advertising widely as it reaches to each and every invidual.Now a days not only developing quality content is important but also marketing plays a vital role in getting ameliorate profits because there are adequate amount of new quality concepts are establishing daily,when it is properly gone in to people only will result in summon money and production people should hire marketing team who are efficient in reaching to public with smart  and appropriate tricks that would attarct customers.

In a nutshell ,marketing people should analyze properly and make crowd to walkthrough to the quality screens for that they should plan from now ,which would result in profit next year
